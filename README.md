```

**3. Access the app:**
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:8000/api/](http://localhost:8000/api/)

## üë• Default Users

Upon running the project, the following users are available for testing:

- **user1@example.com** / `demo123`  
  - Initial balance: USD 1000, EUR 500, ILS 2000

- **user2@example.com** / `demo123`  
  - Initial balance: USD 0, EUR 0, ILS 0

## üóÑÔ∏è Database & Seeding

- **MySQL 8.0** container auto-creates the `wallet` database.
- **Schema and seed data** are loaded automatically from [`backend/init.sql`](backend/init.sql):
  - **Tables:** `users`, `transactions`
  - **Seed users:**
    - `user1@example.com` (id: 1, initial: USD 1000, EUR 500, ILS 2000)
    - `user2@example.com` (id: 2, initial: USD 0, EUR 0, ILS 0)
- **No manual SQL or DB creation required.**

---

## üîê Authentication & Security

- **Session-based authentication:** Secure login/logout with PHP sessions. Only authenticated users can access the dashboard and perform actions.
- **User-specific dashboard:** All balances, transactions, and actions are tied to the currently logged-in user. No manual user selection.
- **Password confirmation for transfers:** Before sending money, users must re-enter their password for extra security.
- **Change password:** Users can securely change their password from the profile/settings modal.

  - The most recent historical rate is used for equivalent value calculations, ensuring consistency across the dashboard.

## üìà Dashboard Features

- **Modern, responsive UI** with TailwindCSS and custom design.
