## üë§ Multi-User Support

- **User selector** in the frontend: switch between `user1@example.com` and `user2@example.com`.
- All wallet actions (deposit, transfer, currency exchange, view balances) are user-specific.
- Transfers are performed by entering the recipient's email.

## üí± Currency & Exchange Rate Features

- **Supported:** USD, EUR, GBP, ILS (Israeli Shekel)
- All wallet operations and balances support ILS natively.
- **Live exchange rates** are fetched from the backend and displayed in the dashboard.
- **Currency Exchange:**
  - The dashboard features a unified card for **Quick Deposit** and **Currency Exchange**.
  - Instantly convert between currencies in your wallet using the latest available rate.
  - **Exchange rate logic:**
    - The backend fetches rates for the last 5 days from the Bank of Israel API.
    - The most recent available rate (starting from today, going backwards) is used for conversions.
    - If no rate is found in the last 5 days, the conversion fails gracefully.
    - The confirmation popup before conversion shows the exact date of the rate being used.
- **Historical Exchange Rates:**
  - The dashboard displays a chart of historical rates (USD/EUR/GBP to ILS) for the last 3 months.
  - The most recent historical rate is used for equivalent value calculations, ensuring consistency across the dashboard.

## üìà Dashboard Features

- **Modern, responsive UI** with TailwindCSS and custom design.

  - Equivalent values in ILS are shown where relevant.
- **Quick deposit, transfer, and exchange:** Instantly add funds, transfer, or exchange between currencies with a simple, intuitive UI.
